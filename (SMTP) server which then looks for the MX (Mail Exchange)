Hello GitHub;

It has been a very long time since I have worked directly with computer software.
I started using computers when Microsoft (DOS 3.2) was released using (5 1/4") floppies. 
Many years ago I designed a top down chart for a plastic moulding manufacture to fully 
operate from using many calculations, foot work, manual paper work,
to a fully modern automated manufacturing company using computer software.  
At the time (C+) compiler was the best to use.
Also through the many decades, I have become very aware how trojans and worms operate.  

I have been using Thunderbird email for many decades from the very beginning.
Around February 21, 2019 I received a Thunderbird Email update,
(60.5.1.exe) then updated again to (60.5.2.exe). (Lightning Version ?)

When it comes to email security, you have totally deleted a very very important secure feature.
Only Thunderbird email software had this very important email secure feature.
RE: "Delivery Status Notification".
For me when "Delivery Status Notification" was still available, 
I could insure (100%) that my (business, lawyers, tax forms, etc.) were received.

Support Forum:
Thunderbird no longer pings if email was received

This is a Thunderbird support forum.
There were (2) contributors that did not know how "Delivery Status Notification" actually worked.
How to Verify an Email Address.. 
Ping an Email Address to Validate it!.. When you send an email to someone, 
the message goes to an SMTP server which then looks for the MX (Mail Exchange) records of the email recipient’s domain..

Your previous versions of Thunderbird had this in your above "Option" folder.
Add this very important secure email delivery to your new Thunderbird email "Option" location.
Please, again add this very important secure email delivery to your new Thunderbird email "Option" location.
Add a "Delivery Status Notification" option.
Also especially notify that this very important option "Delivery Status Notification",
* To insure that very important information was received 
* Will ping an email address
* Checking an (SMTP) server which then looks for the MX (Mail Exchange) records of the email recipient’s domain

If the email was "correctly" received;
A fully detailed "Delivery Status Notification" = email received.

If the email was "not" received;
A fully detailed "Delivery Status Notification" = email NOT received.
Due To:
* Email address no longer exists
* Email sending format error, attachments (images, documents)

The importance of "Validation", that an email was sent, that an email was received, 
could be your greatest assist, because (99.99%) of individuals never knew that it previously existed.  

Suggestion Only;
To the right side of your [Quick Filter] icon
add a very important simple [Email Received] icon 
because no one individual even in

<*******@t-online.de>  (relayed to non-DSN-aware mailer)

Thanks for your time.
